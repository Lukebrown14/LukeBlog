## !Kang People

#### Their unique answer to egomaniacs and narcissists

The !Kung people are a hunting and gathering tribe living on the western edge of the Kalahari desert in 
an area called Ovamboland. !Kung have a beautifully elegant system for preventing their hunters from 
becoming too big head.

When the hunter returns from a successful hunter, they are not met with praise and celebration from the 
tribe’s people. They are instead met and undergo a ritual called by anthropologists “insulting the meat”, 
where the people insult the hunter with criticisms such as “You mean to say you have dragged us out here to 
make us cart home your pile of bones.” Now, this may seem cruel and slightly odd, but as one tribe member 
explained to the Canadian anthropologist Richard Lee in the 1970s:

> “When a young man kills much meat, he thinks of himself as a chief or a big man, and he thinks of the 
rest of us as his servants or inferiors. We can’t accept this. We refuse one who boasts, for someday his 
pride will make him kill somebody. So we always speak of his meat as worthless. In this way, we cool his 
heart and make him gentle.”

If insulting the meat doesn't dissuade big-headed hunters, the !Kung people have one final tactic to humble 
the individual. When the !Kung uses arrowheads for hunting, but these are not owned by the hunter but by 
different families or other individuals. These arrowheads are regularly swapped between the hunters, 
essentially making arrowheads randomly distributed. Now here is the exciting aspect of this practice. 
The credit for the hunt goes to the owner of the arrowhead. Because of the random distribution of 
arrowheads, approximately equal recognition is given across the different families. All of this cause a 
flat societal structure with no narcissistic hunters.
