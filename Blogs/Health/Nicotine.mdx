## Nicotine 

### The potenial health benfit of nicotine

"Preclinical models and human studies have demonstrated that nicotine has cognitive-enhancing effects, including improved fine motor functions, attention, working memory, and episodic memory" [1]. Study participants do not get addicted or experience withdrawal.

Research suggests the drug may protect against the early stages of Alzheimer's disease. A study involving sixty-seven people with mild cognitive impairment, in which memory is slightly impaired but decision-making and other cognitive abilities remain within normal levels, found "significant nicotine-associated improvements in attention, memory, and psychomotor speed," with excellent safety and tolerability [2]. Losing nicotinic cholinergic receptors (which nicotine binds to and activates) impairs cognitive function. Thus nicotine can help counteract some of the symptoms of Alzheimer's. This becomes less true in patients with later-stage Alzheimer, as very few nicotine receptors are left for nicotine to work on [3]. Caffeine with the combination of 1 mg of nicotine gum has been shown to reduce appetite [4]

Pharmacological Effects
 • Nicotine increases neurotransmitter levels across the board, including catecholamines (dopamine, adrenaline, and non-epinephrine), beta-endorphins, serotonin, and even cortisol, the stress hormone, which may not be so good a thing.
 • It has a half-life of 1-2 hours.
 • The binding site with the highest affinity to nicotine is the alpha-4-beta-2-nicotinic receptor. Interestingly, stimulation of this binding site increases human growth hormone secretion.
